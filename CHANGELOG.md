# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Stockfish stuck on "starting" / auto-move never playing** — Stockfish 19 ships one `universal`
  build per architecture, and the downloader fell back to the first Windows zip: the ARM64 build,
  which can't run on x64 PCs. It now picks the build for the host CPU, and a wrong-architecture or
  corrupt `stockfish.exe` from an earlier download is replaced automatically on launch
- Engine launch and download failures now show as an error instead of leaving the status on "starting"
- An eval requested while the engine is still starting is run once it's ready (auto-move no longer
  waits for the next move)

## [2.0.2] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Connection refused (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`)** — the WebSocket server now binds both the
  IPv4 (`127.0.0.1`) and IPv6 (`::1`) loopback, so the extension connects regardless of how the OS
  resolves localhost
- **Auto-move freezing after one move** — player color is no longer clobbered to `null` mid-game, so
  auto-move keeps playing each turn
- **Single instance** — a second launch focuses the existing window instead of racing for the port

### Added
- Update check shows the installed version, commit hash, and channel (stable/beta)

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **In-app auto-updater** — checks GitHub for new versions on launch and from About → Updates; one
  click runs `git pull`/checkout → reinstall → rebuild → relaunch
- **Beta channel** — toggle in About: on = update on every commit to `main`; off (default) = released
  tags only

### Fixed
- **Eval bar no longer flips each move** — scores are normalized to White's perspective (Stockfish
  reports relative to the side to move)
- **Crash on engine death** — guarded Stockfish stdin writes (no more `write EPIPE` taking down the
  app) with a bounded auto-restart

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Rebuilt as an Electron desktop app** (React + Vite) — owns Stockfish and the WebSocket server
- **Overlay is now a slim C# helper** (`ChessistOverlay.exe`) driven by the desktop app over stdin — same transparent, screen-capture-invisible window
- **No setup.bat, no native messaging** — the app downloads Stockfish on first run; the extension is a pure WebSocket client
- **Faster within a game** — one persistent Stockfish process with a large hash and multiple threads; the transposition table is reused across moves and reset only on a new game
- **Settings live in the app** — a sidebar with Evaluation, Game, Engine, Setup, About; the app is the single settings authority and pushes settings to the extension over WS. The extension popup is now just a connectivity indicator, and its options page is gone
- **Three render modes** — *Overlay* (transparent native window), *In-page* (drawn on the chess site), or *App* (the desktop window draws its own board + best-move arrows; nothing in the browser)
- **Guided extension install** — the installer bundles the extension; the Setup tab reveals the folder and walks through loading it
- **Bundled font + logo** — Instrument Sans as the app font; Chessist logo for the window/installer icon, title bar, and About
- **Repo reorganized** — Electron app at root, browser extension under `extension/`, overlay under `overlay/`
- Removed the C# engine, native-messaging host, and WASM remnants

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Lean repo** — compiled binaries removed from git; repo is now ~4 MB instead of ~170 MB
- **GitHub Actions CI** — tagged releases (`v*.*.*`) build and publish `chessist-engine-windows.zip`
- **setup.bat downloads binaries** — `ChessistEngine.exe` and `stockfish.exe` are fetched from GitHub releases on first run (skipped if already present)
- **Auto-download Stockfish** — `ChessistEngine.exe` re-fetches Stockfish automatically if missing, with download progress broadcast over WebSocket
- **Extension detection** — the engine detects when the Chrome extension is connected (via an `identify` message)
- **Eldritch theme** — the status panel adopts a flat pitch-black aesthetic with the Chessist purple (`#792A9E`) accent
- **BootstrapGate** — the status panel shows a setup checklist (engine → Stockfish → extension) until everything is ready

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Removed WASM engine** — `ChessistEngine.exe` (native Stockfish) is now the sole analysis engine; no WASM fallback
- **Removed Python dependency** — `ChessistEngine.exe` now acts as its own native-messaging host (HostBridge mode)
- **Bundled Stockfish** — `stockfish.exe` is included; no separate install required
- **Zero-prompt setup** — `setup.bat` requires no user input; extension ID is pinned via manifest key
- **React+Vite status panel** — tray icon → "Open Panel" shows live engine status, eval depth, score, and NPS
- Repo reorganized: `overlay/` → `engine/`, `native-host/` → `host/`, dev scripts → `scripts/`
- `ChessistEngine.exe` prevents duplicate instances via named mutex

---

## v1.3.0 — Chessist Engine

### Added
- **Chessist Engine** — native C# engine host replaces Python native messaging; run `ChessistEngine.exe` and Stockfish analysis streams directly to the extension over WebSocket with no Python dependency
- **Always-on WebSocket engine connection** — content scripts connect to the engine on page load regardless of overlay mode; no manual engine-source switching required
- **WASM fallback** — extension automatically falls back to the built-in WASM Stockfish when ChessistEngine.exe is not running; no configuration needed
- **Bidirectional eval protocol** — same WebSocket connection used for overlay display and engine eval requests; engine streams multi-PV results back as JSON `eval` messages
- **Engine status indicator** — popup shows live engine connection state (connected / not running)

### Removed
- **Python native messaging host** — no longer needed; Python and the `websockets` pip package are not required
- **Engine source toggle** — replaced with automatic detection; extension uses native engine when available, WASM when not
- `setup.bat` no longer requires Python, pip, or extension ID for native messaging registration

### Changed
- `setup.bat` simplified — only checks for Stockfish and optionally adds ChessistEngine.exe to Windows startup

---

## v1.2.2 — Performance update

### Changed
- **MultiPV 1 by default** — Stockfish now searches a single line unless "Show Alternative Arrows" is enabled, cutting analysis time roughly in half for most positions
- **Dynamic MultiPV toggle** — enabling/disabling alternative arrows at runtime sends `setoption name MultiPV` live to the engine without requiring a restart
- **Stealth Mode** - enabled by default

### Fixed
- **Per-eval storage read removed** — `engineDepth` is now cached in memory and updated on change; previously a `chrome.storage.sync.get` was awaited on every single eval request, adding unnecessary latency
- **Parallel tab broadcasts** — `EVAL_RESULT` messages are now sent to all content-script tabs simultaneously (`Promise.all`) instead of sequentially, reducing broadcast overhead with multiple tabs open
- **Tab ID cache** — content-script tab IDs are cached between broadcasts and only re-queried when tabs open, close, or navigate, eliminating repeated `chrome.tabs.query` calls on every Stockfish depth line

---

## v1.2.1 — Overlay fixes

### Fixed
- **Overlay not drawing on page load** — eval completed before the WebSocket connected so nothing was ever sent; last evaluation is now cached and immediately replayed when the overlay connects
- **Overlay hiding when extension popup opens** — `window.blur` fired whenever the popup opened, sending `visible: false`; replaced with `visibilitychange` which only fires on actual tab switches and minimises
- **Overlay hiding on alt-tab** — added `GetForegroundWindow()` check in the C# render loop; overlay blanks only when a non-browser window is foreground
- **Debug mode overlay blank** — `AllocConsole()` window (owned by the overlay process) caused `IsActualBrowser()` to return false; added `_selfPid` check to whitelist the overlay's own windows
- **"View Logs" opening a hidden log window** — replaced the in-process `LogWindow` form with file-based logging (`ChessistOverlay.log`) opened in the system default text editor

### Added
- **Debug Mode toggle** — sub-option under Overlay Mode; restarts the overlay exe with `-debug` flag, showing a console window for live troubleshooting
- **Always-on file logging** — overlay writes a timestamped log to `ChessistOverlay.log` in all modes (not just debug)

---

## v1.2.0 — Overlay update

### Added
- **Native overlay window** — transparent C# WinForms window drawn over the browser using `UpdateLayeredWindow` with premultiplied alpha; invisible to screen capture (`SetWindowDisplayAffinity`)
- **Pixel-accurate positioning** — overlay uses `EnumChildWindows` to find `Chrome_RenderWidgetHostHWND` and `ClientToScreen` to get the exact web content origin, bypassing Chrome's unreliable JS screen coordinate APIs
- **Drag tracking** — 16ms timer re-polls `ClientToScreen` so the overlay follows the browser window in real time
- **Maximize sync** — `ResizeObserver` on the board element fires post-reflow so overlay resizes correctly after maximize/restore
- **Focus sync** — overlay hides on `window.blur` and reappears on `window.focus`; Electron apps (VS Code, Discord) are excluded via process-name check
- **Settings sync** — overlay respects Show Best Move, Show Opponent's Best Move, Show Alternative Arrows, and Target Depth; arrows are only drawn when analysis reaches target depth
- **Show Opponent's Best Move** toggle — best-move arrow stays visible during the opponent's turn; appears as a sub-option under Show Best Move
- **Overlay status indicator** — live dot in the popup shows whether the overlay is connected or still connecting, polling every second

## v1.1.0 - Lichess update

### Added
- **Lichess support** — full eval bar, best-move arrows, move classification icons, auto-move, accuracy tracking, W/L balance, auto-rematch, and all other features now work on lichess.org in addition to Chess.com
- **Lichess auto-move** — uses click-to-move directly on Chessground (CSP blocks inline script injection on lichess)
- **Lichess spectator mode** — eval bar and best-move arrows calculate for both sides when watching games on the home TV feed or any spectated game
- **Puzzle mode detection** — Lichess training/puzzle pages follow the current turn for color detection
- **Instant move disables timing controls** — delay min/max inputs and Smart Timing toggle are greyed out and non-interactive when Instant Move is enabled

### Fixed
- **Lichess CSP violation** — removed `tryPageContextMove` which injected inline scripts blocked by lichess's Content Security Policy, causing auto-move to silently do nothing
- **Accuracy icons showing when disabled on Lichess** — popup settings changes were only broadcast to Chess.com tabs; Lichess tabs now receive all setting updates immediately
- **Auto-move firing on spectated Lichess games** — auto-move is now gated to games where the user is an active participant; no longer attempts moves on the home TV feed or top-rated player games
- **Stale accuracy when force-moving during calculation** — `prevCpWhite` now updates on every eval depth rather than only at target depth, so manually moving before Stockfish finishes no longer causes accuracy to be calculated from a two-move-old eval
- **Best-move arrow only showing for white when spectating** — `detectPlayerColor()` incorrectly read board orientation on TV/home page boards; now returns `null` when not in own game so arrows are drawn for whichever side is to move
- **`.rclock` false positive in spectator detection** — clock elements are visible to spectators too; own-game detection now relies solely on `lichess.round.data.player.color`
- **Puzzle mode broken by spectator detection** — puzzle URLs (`/training/...`) matched the 8-char game ID pattern and triggered the `isInOwnGame()` check too early; puzzle check is now evaluated first

---

## v1.0.2

### Added
- **Live accuracy display** on the eval bar — shows your running average accuracy as a colored icon + percentage (green/yellow/red based on performance)
- **Accuracy persistence** — accuracy is saved to local storage per game ID and restored on page refresh mid-game
- **Move classification icons** on the board — best, excellent, good, inaccuracy, mistake, blunder icons drawn at the destination square after each move
- **Show Move Icon** toggle in popup settings
- **Auto-move** via `chrome.scripting.executeScript({ world: 'MAIN' })` — runs in page context with trusted events for reliable move submission
- **Smart timing** for auto-move — adjusts delay based on move complexity, eval magnitude, and captures
- **Target Accuracy** setting — intentionally play at a lower accuracy percentage
- **W/L Balance** — automatically throws a game after winning too many in a row, then wins the next
- **Match Player ELO** — Stockfish plays at your detected Chess.com rating; supports manual override
- **Auto Rematch / Auto New Game** after game ends
- **Stealth Mode** — suppresses all console logs
- **Best move arrow** drawn as SVG overlay on the board
- **Native Stockfish engine** support via native messaging host (much faster than WASM)
- **PV cache** — instant eval response when opponent plays the expected move
- **Position cache** — revisited positions return instantly from cache

### Fixed
- Auto-move `movePending` deadlock that blocked every move after the first in bot games
- Move icon appearing on the wrong square (FROM instead of TO)
- CSP blocking inline script injection — removed `tryPageContextMove` in favour of service worker scripting
- `moveIconEl is not defined` error after cleanup of old eval bar elements
- Accuracy eval never triggering because opponent's position wasn't being evaluated
- Eval bar glitching on game load due to `board.game.move()` mutating the DOM silently
